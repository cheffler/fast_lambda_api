# Fast Lambda API

This is a development dependency library to support the developer experience of working in an API First process with AWS Lambdas and AWS API Gateway.

It has two main objectives:

- Support the creation of an OpenAPI spec from Code that is comprehensive and supports AWS API Gateway operations
- Provide a local simple API handler that mimics, very simply, the Lambda environment to speed of development

The basis of this tooling is the OpenAPI specification portability and can provide advantages in a number of different scenarios. The spec can be used to:

- Create an AWS API Gateway
- Generate interactive documentation for your APIs
- Autogenerate and SDK in a number of languages to empower clients to use your API
- Be injected into Postman and other API tools

The tooling provides a place to create and document APIs powered by document enriched models, these APIs can be decorated to link a Lambda handler.

This library is a development only tool, therefore it does not provide any tooling to help with the Lambda handlers or more. There are a few good libraries out there to provide frameworks for your Lambda code, one in particular is [AWS Lambda Powertools](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python).

## Getting Started

> this section explains how to get started and work with this repo, using the library in other projects will come in time...

This repo uses `Python3`, `pyenv` and `pipenv` as a base, so have these installed and be familiar how to use them on a basic level (that's all I know anyway)

```sh
# setup virtual env and install dependencies
pipenv install
```

```sh
# Run the basic example
pipenv run basic

# swagger like docs are available at localhost:8000/docs
# redocly like docs are available at localhost:8000/redoc
```

### CLI Commands

Below are some working examples of the CLI commands built to-date

| Command | Description | Example |
|----|----|----|
| `pipenv run basic`| Run the basic example ||
| `pipenv run cli export --help`| View the help for the export CLI|
| `pipenv run cli export --filter v1` | Export an API spec filtering for APIs|`pipenv run cli export -t examples/basic/main.py --filter v2`|
| `pipenv run cli export -p` | Export private APIs to separate files||

## Use Cases

- API First
- Create an API spec
- OpenAPI Spec to create API Gateway
- Alternatives to using the Spec
