MAIN_DESCRIPTION = """One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that–lacking zero–they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs. (Robert Firth) If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside. (Robert X. Cringely) 640K ought to be enough for anybody. (Bill Gates, 1981) If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization. (Gerald Weinberg)

A hacker on a roll may be able to produce–in a period of a few months something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year. IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more. (Peter Seebach) Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more ‘user-friendly’… Their best approach so far has been to take all the old brochures and stamp the words ‘user-friendly’ on the cover. (Bill Gates) Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. (Alan Kay) The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds)

I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal) Never trust a computer you can’t throw out a window. (Steve Wozniak) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to think out every case. (Francis Glassborow)"""
